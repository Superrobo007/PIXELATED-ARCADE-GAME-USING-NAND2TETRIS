# PIXELATED-ARCADE-GAME

Pixelated Arcade is a simple retro-style game built entirely on the Hack platform from the nand2tetris course. Using Hack assembly and basic HDL logic, it demonstrates how classic arcade mechanics like movement, collisions, and scoring can be implemented at a low hardware level. This project is purely educational, showcasing how games can emerge from the ground up starting with NAND gates.
